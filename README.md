# :earth_americas: Portfolio Tracking for Smart Impulse

Our project focuses on creating a dynamic, automated Virtual Portfolio (VP) tracking system for Smart Impulse,
aimed at streamlining investment management. The system downloads stock lists daily, automatically identifies
new entries and exits, and manages investments based on predefined conditions. With an initial investment of
$100,000, the portfolio's performance is continuously monitored, and entries are made strategically to maximize
returns. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights, including ROI calculations, top performers and losers,
and portfolio distribution, with real-time updates delivered through Telegram.
